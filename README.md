# URL Shortener

This is the most basic URL Shortener in existence, built to power the following requirements

- The shortened URL should be as compact as possible, using a combination of alphanumeric characters (like Base62 encoding).
- Use a simple in-memory storage for URL mappings (e.g., a dictionary).
- Track and display access counts for each shortened URL.

## Code

You can find the implementation inside [`router.js`](./router.js). All the code in [`app.js`](./app.js) and [`bin/www`](./bin/www) were automatically generated by the `express-generator` command and were only adapted for readability, they're just boilerplate.

## Running

Simply install the libraries with

```bash
$ npm install
```

and then run the app with

```bash
$ npm run start
```

## Accessing the server

The server will be available in `localhost:3000`. The available endpoints are:

- `localhost:3000/shorten?url=<your url here>`
- `localhost:3000/r/<short hash here>`
- `localhost:3000/analytics/<short hash here>`
